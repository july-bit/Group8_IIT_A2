        <h3> What is Robots? </h3>
        <p>
            According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is a model for
            enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
            resources
            (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released
            with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. (Ruparelia 2016, p. 4).
            <br>
            That means, rather than having to spend money for purchasing and maintaining costly IT infrastructures,
            businesses can now rent access to anything from applications, storage, networking, databases, etc.
            from a cloud service provider (CSP) such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, etc
            (Ranger 2018).
            <br>
            Cloud computing generally follows three delivery models, namely:
            <li>
                <b>Public clouds:</b> These are owned and operated by 3rd-party CSPs, of which all hardware, software,
                and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider.
                This model is what most people are familiar with, where the consumption of public cloud services (files
                storage on Google Drive, music streaming platforms, Office Online, etc.)
                happens via the Internet rather than a private or restricted network (Ruparelia 2016, p. 30).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Private clouds:</b> Here, computing resources are used exclusively by a single business,
                organization, or in some cases, a single person.
                A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter, allowing the company to
                control how the data is being used, shared, stored,
                as well as how to build the infrastructure they want. This model is particularly useful for
                organizations that prioritise security and privacy of their data above all else.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Hybrid clouds:</b> A combination of public and private clouds, bound together by technology that
                allows data and applications to be shared between them.
                By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives
                businesses greater flexibility in terms of daily operations.
            </li>
            <br>
        <p>Within these models, there exists three types of cloud services, or “stacks”, as they are built on top of one
            another: </p>
        <li>
            <b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):</b> The most basic category of cloud computing service or the base
            stack,
            where companies can rent out IT infrastructures such as physical or virtual servicers, storage, network on a
            pay-as-you-go basis.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Platform as a service (PaaS):</b> The next layer up where CPSs provide an on-demand environment for
            developing, testing,
            delivering and managing software applications. Thus, making it easier for developers to quickly create web
            or mobile apps,
            without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure needed for development work.

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Software as a service (SaaS):</b> The most common form of cloud computing where applications are
            delivered over the internet,
            on demand and typically on a subscription basis e.g. Google G Suite, Microsoft 365, Adobe Creative Cloud,
            etc. With SaaS,
            cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure. Users connect to the
            application over the Internet
            usually via a web browser or on their phone or tablet. Ranger (2018, para. 18) noted that SaaS spending in
            2019 was dominated by application purchases,
            making up for more than half of all public cloud spending.

        <h3>What is the likely impact? </h3>
        <p>
            Within the workplace, Ruparelia (2016) predicted two major trends. The first trend is where workstations
            would gradually be replaced by zero or thin clients -
            machines that do not have applications installed on them- where workers would perform most daily tasks via
            cloud-based application via a web browser
            e.g. document-editing or emailing. This reduces the need for organizations to have to manage all those
            applications installed on a variety of workstation.
            Another benefit is data security since these thin clients would not contain any local disk but instead store
            data on the cloud (p.63).
            <br>
            The second trend is ubiquitous computing or bring your own device (BYOD), where employees can access
            corporate-provided applications and information on their own personal devices anytime and anywhere.
            The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend by the fact that many employees were forced to work from home,
            often with their own devices.
            In the future, as more companies adopt the hybrid work model (where employees can split their time between
            working from home and at the office),
            it is possible to assume that this will result in cost reduction for company's IT department in term of It
            equipment deployment, maintenance, and so on.

            We predict that our personal lives will come to be more reliant on cloud computing.
            Specifically, each person will have a collection of personal clouds corresponding to their needs &
            behaviours.
            For example, an entertainment cloud such as Apple TV, Google TV or Roku, where they can get access to their
            own library of on-demand and downloadable content.
            <br>
            If we take shopping into account, then our personal shopping cloud: would help us find better deals and
            discounts,
            (Honey is a good example of a shopping assistant that uses its own cloud to scan the web for discounts on
            major platforms such as Amazon & eBay),
            analyze our shopping behaviors and buying patterns for predictive analysis. E.g if a person regularly buys
            toilet paper on the 20th then he/she will remind him/her to buy the item one or two days prior.
